Algorithmic Fairness Dashboard ⚖️

# Algorithmic Fairness Dashboard

## 📌 Overview
Algorithmic fairness is a critical aspect of machine learning, ensuring that models do not disproportionately favor or disadvantage specific demographic groups. The **Algorithmic Fairness Dashboard** is an interactive visualization tool designed to analyze and audit the fairness of machine learning models using various fairness metrics.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Evaluate fairness across different demographic groups.
- Visualize fairness metrics using an interactive dashboard.
- Provide actionable insights to mitigate bias in models.
- Support various fairness definitions (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds).

## 🚀 Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algorithmic_fairness_dashboard.git
cd algorithmic_fairness_dashboard
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🛠️ Usage
1. **Prepare Your Data**: Ensure your dataset includes sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race, age).
2. **Run Fairness Analysis**:
   ```bash
   python src/fairness_metrics.py --input data/model_predictions.csv
   ```
3. **Launch Dashboard**:
   ```bash
   python src/dashboard.py
   ```
4. **Interpret Results**: Use the interactive dashboard to explore fairness metrics and identify potential biases.

## 📊 Fairness Metrics Included
- **Demographic Parity**: Measures whether the prediction rates are equal across groups.
- **Equalized Odds**: Compares false positive and false negative rates across groups.
- **Disparate Impact**: Evaluates the ratio of favorable outcomes between groups.
- **Statistical Parity Difference**: Quantifies the difference in positive prediction rates.

## 🏗️ Future Work
- Add support for more fairness definitions.
- Integrate model debugging features.
- Allow real-time monitoring of fairness during training.
